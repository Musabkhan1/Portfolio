      <p>Hiring Manager</p>
      <p>Scotiabank - Global Banking and Markets</p>
      <p>Scarborough, ON</p>

      <p><strong>Re: Software Developer (React.js/Node.js), Requisition ID: 209953</strong></p>

      <p>
        Dear Hiring Manager,
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m excited to apply for the Software Developer role in Scotiabank’s Global Banking and Markets team. With over
        two years of experience as a full-stack developer, specializing in React and Node.js, I’m confident that I can
        bring both technical skill and a strong focus on building great user experiences to your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my previous role at T7E Aftermarket Connect Pvt, I worked on creating a custom client dashboard and
        collaborated closely with UX/UI teams to improve our applications. This role taught me the importance of
        understanding user needs and building software that’s both efficient and user-friendly—values I see reflected in
        Scotiabank’s customer-focused culture. I also have a background as a data analyst intern at Disney+ Hotstar,
        where I learned how to work with large datasets and extract useful insights, skills that I believe would be
        valuable in the highly regulated and data-driven environment at Scotiabank.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m especially drawn to Scotiabank’s inclusive culture and the chance to be part of a high-performing team
        that’s committed to innovation in digital banking. I’m confident my experience, combined with my dedication to
        clear, organized code and efficient project management, would make me a great addition to your team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for considering my application. I’d love to discuss how my background and skills align with
        Scotiabank’s goals. Please feel free to reach me at 437 990 2374 or musab.khan1@gmail.com.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best regards,<br>
